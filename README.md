$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \epsilon$$

In this formula, $y$ represents the response variable (the variable we are trying to predict), $x_1$ represents the predictor variable (the variable we are using to make the prediction), $\beta_0$ represents the intercept (the value of $y$ when $x_1$ is 0), $\beta_1$ represents the slope (the change in $y$ for a one-unit increase in $x_1$), and $\epsilon$ represents the error term (the part of $y$ that cannot be explained by the predictor variable).

This formula can be used to model the relationship between $y$ and $x_1$ and to make predictions about $y$ for new values of $x_1$.
